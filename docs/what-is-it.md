## What is MLIR?

MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) is a compiler infrastructure project that provides a unified, extensible intermediate representation for compiler infrastructures. Originally developed by Google as part of the TensorFlow ecosystem, MLIR is now part of the LLVM project.

### Key Features

- **Flexible Multi-level Design**: MLIR supports multiple levels of abstraction within the same representation, enabling progressive lowering from high-level abstractions to machine code.
- **Extensible Dialect System**: MLIR uses "dialects" to encapsulate domain-specific abstractions, operations, and transformations.
- **Reusable Infrastructure**: Common compiler functionality like type systems, optimization passes, and transformation frameworks can be shared across different domains.
- **Progressive Lowering**: Supports gradual and selective lowering of abstractions, allowing for optimization at different levels.

### Common Use Cases

- Machine learning compiler frameworks
- Hardware-specific optimizations
- DSL (Domain-Specific Language) implementation
- High-performance computing
